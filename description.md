The main problem nowadays for the students studying in universities
is money management. No matter how hard they try at the end they end up
with insufficient funds. So, I tried to find a solution for this. I will try to
solve this student’s issue through an e-commercial website which will be
implemented by a database Mongo-DB and scripting language PHP. This will help the students 
to buy things at a relatively cheaper rates and the students who don’t require their
stuffs any more can sell here and earn some cash thus helping them with
their money issues.
